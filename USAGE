Description:
    The 'gimbal' command creates a new Rails application at the path you specify.

    The generated application structure is an opinionated configuration based on my
    personal preferences.

    You can find the source of this generator on GitHub: https://github.com/pacso/gimbal

Example:
    gimbal ~/Code/Ruby/weblog

    This generates a Rails installation in ~/Code/Ruby/weblog.
    See the README in the newly created application to get going.
